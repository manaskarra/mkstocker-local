# MKStocker - Personal Stock Portfolio Tracker

A personal project born out of necessity. As someone who invests across stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and more, I needed a unified real-time dashboard to track my entire portfolio without restrictions or hidden fees.

MKStocker is built to provide full control over financial data, supporting multi-currency tracking, real-time insights, and a fully customizable experience tailored to individual investment strategies. Whether it’s monitoring performance, analyzing trends, or optimizing holdings, MKStocker makes it seamless and intuitive.

Developed with React and Flask, this project reflects my growing passion for finance and technology. Looking ahead, I’m excited to explore advanced analytics, risk assessment, and AI-powered insights to make investing more efficient and data-driven.
