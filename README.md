# MKStocker - Personal Stock Portfolio Tracker

A personal project born out of necessity. As someone who invests across various asset classes (stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, etc.), I needed a unified dashboard to track my entire portfolio in one place.

Commercial apps often cause unusual delays, lack multi-currency support or charge premium fees for even the most basic features. MKStocker gives me complete control over my financial data while providing the real-time insights I need to make informed investment decisions. 

Built with React and Flask, this project reflects my growing interest in finance and trading. As a new investor, I’m eager to explore the intersection of technology and finance.”
